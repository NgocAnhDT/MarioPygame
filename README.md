## Starting
You need these python libraries:
* pygame
* pytmx

 Then just open 'Next/main.py' and execute it.

## About
**Sorry for very bad English.**
The game based on pygame library with loading .tmx level using pytmx library.

Only level 1-1 was finished due to lack of time, but most of the work is done. 

You can see how the game structure was made and use it in your own project.

That's how main menu looks:
