## About
**Sorry for very bad English.**
The game based on pygame library with loading level from .tmx file using pytmx library.
Only level 1-1 was done due to lack of time, but most of the work is done. You can see 
how the game structure was made and use it in your own project. There are some 
bad and stupid code, but i tried to comment unclear places.
